[![Quantstamp Status](https://quantstamp-badge.herokuapp.com/badge/ubien/quantstampbadge)](https://quantstamp-badge.herokuapp.com/start-audit/ubien/quantstampbadge)  <---- This thing.

## Add a Quantstamp Badge To Your Repo
If you have solidity (.sol) files you want checked for common security fails have Quantstamp's network of auditors run their suite of tools against your code.

## How Does It Work?
Add this link to your `README.md` and replace username/repo
```[![Quantstamp Status](https://quantstamp-badge.herokuapp.com/badge/GITHUB_USERNAME/REPO_NAME)](https://quantstamp-badge.herokuapp.com/start-audit/GITHUB_USERNAME/REPO_NAME)```

The badge will initially start looking like this:
[![Quantstamp Status](https://quantstamp-badge.herokuapp.com/badge/cryptocopycats/awesome-cryptokitties)](https://quantstamp-badge.herokuapp.com/start-audit/cryptocopycats/awesome-cryptokitties) (unless someone funds this).

Once a generous soul ponies up some [QSP](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/quantstamp/) you or they can choose which of your contracts to run an audit on.
